# IBM-Coursera Machine Learning Professional Certificate program



This course discuss the following sections.
Supervised Machine learning
Linear Regression
Data split: Splitting data into train-test sample and using it to train linear regression
Polynomial regression: Use polynomial regression to increase the complexity of a model
Cross Validations techniques(K-Folds cross validation, leave out one cross  validation and stratified cross validation)

Regularization
Lasso(L1 regularisation)
Ridge(L2 regularisation)
ElasticNet(L1 + L2 regularization
