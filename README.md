# IBM-Coursera Machine Learning Professional Certificate program

This repository documents the progress made in an [IBM machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) course, provided through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning). Key skills developed include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, linear, ridge, and lasso regression, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, regression analysis, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. This program comprises 6 different courses indicated below.

## Courses
1) ### Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning.
  This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-exploratory-data-analysis-for-machine-learning) on Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning focuses on essential skills such as retrieving data 
   from various sources (SQL, NoSQL, APIs, Cloud)
* Data cleaning
* Feature selection
* Feature engineering
* Identifying and handling outliers.
2) ### Supervied Machine Learning: Regression
  This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-regression/) on Supervised Machine Learning Regression focuses on essential skills such as follows.
* Train Regression models to predict continuous outcomes.
* Use error metrics to compare different models
* Model best practices
  i) Train and Test split
  ii) Regularization techniques
    - Lasso(L1 regularization)
    - Ridge(L2 regularization)
    - ElasticNet(L1+L2)
