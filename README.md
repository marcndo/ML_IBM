# IBM-Coursera Machine Learning Professional Certificate program

This repository documents the progress made in an [IBM machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) course, provided through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning). Key skills developed include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, linear, ridge, and lasso regression, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, regression analysis, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

This course discuss the following sections.
Supervised Machine learning
Linear Regression
Data split: Splitting data into train-test sample and using it to train linear regression
Polynomial regression: Use polynomial regression to increase the complexity of a model
Cross Validations techniques(K-Folds cross validation, leave out one cross  validation and stratified cross validation)

Regularization
Lasso(L1 regularisation)
Ridge(L2 regularisation)
ElasticNet(L1 + L2 regularization
